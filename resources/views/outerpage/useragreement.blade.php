                <li><b>2. Our Services : </b></li>
                <li><b>2.1 Digital Currency Services :</b> Hashcodex PAY ’s VASP Services or the
                    services of their partners enable you to store, track, transfer, manage and
                    convert your balances (collectively, “Digital Currency Transactions”) of
                    certain supported digital currencies in digital currency wallets hosted by
                    Hashcodex PAY , as the case may be. We will process Digital Currency
                    Transactions in accordance with the instructions we receive from you. When
                    you request that an Additional Counterparty receive or deposit digital
                    currency into your Account from another one of your accounts or wallets or
                    request that such Additional Counterparty transfer digital currency to
                    another wallet or account from your Account, you authorize such Additional
                    Counterparty to execute such transaction via the Services. Prior to
                    submitting instructions to us, you should verify all transaction
                    information. We do not guarantee the identity of any recipient, user,
                    requestee or other party. You cannot reverse a Digital Currency Transaction
                    once it has been broadcast to the relevant digital currency network. If a
                    Digital Currency Transaction has not yet been confirmed on the digital
                    currency network, digital currency associated with such transaction will be
                    designated as pending and will not be included in your digital currency
                    wallet balance or be available to conduct Digital Currency Transactions. You
                    cannot reverse or change any Digital Currency Transaction marked as complete
                    or pending. You must comply with all applicable laws, regulations, licensing
                    requirements and third party rights (including, without limitation, data
                    privacy laws) in your use of the Services. We may refuse to process or
                    cancel any pending Digital Currency Transaction as required by law or any
                    court or other authority to which we are subject in any jurisdiction.</li>
                <li>We further reserve the right to delay any Digital Currency Transaction if we
                    perceive a risk of fraud or illegal activity. We also have the right to
                    refuse to process or cancel any Digital Currency Transaction due to
                    technological issues with the blockchain software, our own software, or for
                    other technological reasons. Our Services are available only in connection
                    with those digital currencies that we support which may change from time to
                    time. A full list of the digital currencies we currently support can be
                    found on the Website at <a href="{{ url('/') }}">Supported Coins</a> . You
                    will not use your Account or your digital currency wallet to store, send,
                    request, or receive digital currencies in any form that we do not support
                    (we will use reasonable efforts to help you move or sell digital currency
                    that we no longer support). We assume no responsibility or liability in
                    connection with any attempt to use your Account or digital currency wallet
                    for digital currencies that we do not support. You agree that you will not
                    receive interest or other earnings in your Account or digital currency
                    wallet from the use of our Services except through your own Digital Currency
                    Transactions and we have no responsibility or liability to you for Digital
                    Currency Transactions conducted by you or conducted by us in accordance with
                    your instructions. You are prohibited from using our Services for any
                    illegal or fraudulent purposes or for the purpose of consummating
                    transactions for any other parties. All digital currency or virtual assets
                    received by an Additional Counterparty into your Account (“Received Assets”)
                    are custodial assets held by such Additional Counterparty for your benefit,
                    as described in further detail below: </li>
                <li><b>(a) Ownership : </b>Title to Received Assets shall at all times remain
                    with you and shall not transfer to the Additional Counterparty, except as
                    provided herein. As the owner of the Received Assets in your Account, you
                    bear all risk of loss of such Received Assets, and we have no responsibility
                    or liability with respect to the value of the digital currency or virtual
                    assets in your Account. We are under no obligation to issue any replacement
                    digital currency, virtual assets or funds in the event that any digital
                    currency, virtual assets, funds or password are lost, stolen,
                    malfunctioning, destroyed or otherwise inaccessible. None of the Received
                    Assets in your Account are the property of the Additional Counterparty. The
                    Additional Counterparty does not represent or treat Received Assets in your
                    Account as belonging to it. However, a court may disagree with such
                    Additional Counterparty’s treatment of your assets and subject them to
                    claims of such Additional Counterparty’s creditors. Except as required by a
                    facially valid court order, applicable law, or except as provided herein,
                    the Additional Counterparty will not sell, transfer, loan, hypothecate or
                    otherwise alienate Received Assets in your Account unless instructed by you
                    or as otherwise authorized by this Agreement. For the avoidance of doubt,
                    each of the Additional Counterparties make no warranty that digital currency
                    or virtual assets in your Account (including Received Assets) are held by
                    you free and clear of any security interest or other lien or encumbrance.
                </li>
                <li><b> (b) Control : </b>. You control the Received Assets. At any time, subject
                    to outages, downtime, and other applicable policies or the other terms of
                    this Agreement, you may withdraw your Received Assets by sending them to a
                    different blockchain address controlled by you or a third party.</li>
                <li><b>(c) Wallets : </b> Unless otherwise instructed and agreed to by an
                    Additional Counterparty, your digital currency will be held in a general

                    its accounting procedures or your digital currency may be held in a separate

                    cannot ensure that a buyer or a seller you are dealing with will complete
                    the Digital Currency Transaction and all risk of a Digital Currency

                    or secure access to our Services or the Hashcodex PAY Site and we make no
                    representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to

                    electronically and you agree to receive all Communications from us in

                    You understand and agree that if we send you a Communication but you do not
                    receive it because your email address on file is incorrect or out of date,

                <li>service provider, or you are otherwise unable to receive a Communication, we
                    will be deemed to have provided the Communication to you whether or not you
                    actually received the Communication. Please note that if you use a spam
                    filter that blocks or re-routes emails from senders not listed in your email
                    address book, you must add Hashcodex PAY to your email address book so that you
                    will be able to receive the Communications we send to you. You can update

                    you by us are returned, we may deem your account to be inactive, and you may
                    not be able to complete any transaction via our Services until we receive a
