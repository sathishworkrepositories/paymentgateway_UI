                                            services to you. A record of any fraud, money laundering or other criminal
                                            risk will be retained by the fraud prevention agencies, and may result in

                                            prevention agencies can hold your information for different periods of time,

                                            data can be held for up to six years. When fraud prevention agencies process
                                            your information, they do so on the basis that they have a legitimate
                                            interest in preventing fraud and money laundering, and to verify your
                                            identity, in order to protect their business and to comply with laws that

                                        <li>By providing you with products or services, we create records containing
                                            your information, such as customer account records and activity and
                                            transaction records. Records can be held on a variety of media (physical or
                                            electronic) and formats, but they are primarily held electronically. We
                                            manage our records to help us to better serve our customers (for example for
                                            operational reasons, such as dealing with any queries relating to your
                                            account) and to comply with legal and regulatory requirements. Records help
                                            us demonstrate that we are meeting our responsibilities and to keep as
                                            evidence of our business activities. Retention periods for records are
                                            determined based on the type of record, the nature of the activity, product
                                            or service, the country in which the relevant Hashcodex PAY company is located
                                            and the applicable local legal or regulatory requirements. We (and other
                                            Hashcodex PAY group companies) normally keep customer account records for up to
                                            six years after your relationship with Hashcodex PAY ends. Retention periods
                                            may be changed from time to time (or waived where deemed low-risk) based on
                                            business or legal and regulatory requirements. Where there has been no
                                            activity on your Hashcodex PAY account since it was opened, we may delete your
                                            data after a period of 6 months, as you will be deemed an "unactivated
                                            user". If there has been any transactional activity on your account, we will
                                            maintain your data until you request that we delete it, unless we are
                                            obligated to maintain such data to comply with our legal obligations. We may
                                            on exception retain your information for longer periods than those stated
                                            above, particularly where we need to withhold destruction or disposal based
                                            on an order from the courts or an investigation by law enforcement agencies
                                            or our regulators. This is intended to make sure that Hashcodex PAY will be
                                            able to produce records as evidence, if they're needed. If you would like
